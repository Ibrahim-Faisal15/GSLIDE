Make two folders:
Frontend
Backend

Build Backend API first

instal flask, flask-cors. in backned

files in backend dir:
config.py
routers.py

config will contain all configuration meaning the API buidling stuff.
routers will contain all the routes for the app

CORS(app)


---Overall Structure---

DIR Backend:
	file create_ppt.py
	file config.py
	text.gen_py
	image_gen.py
	env.py
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
When user click submit button, a request will be sent to the endpoint '/create_ppt', which will contain a route function with a method called text_gen(), which will generate text based on user required topic. another function will be called 
called image_gen() which will generate image for ppt.
